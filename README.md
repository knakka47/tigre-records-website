# bootstrap-test

This is my 1st actual website I've ever created, so please expect there to be much room for improvements. I am trying to go for a cashmoney-records.com kind of aesthetic, and I want my website to primarily be focused on promoting the artists we work with as well as providing our own music-related services that we offer.

A few areas for improvement I've identified:

- Need to change the Hero visual, might just use a high quality picture rather than video.
- Haven't incorporated the Tigre Records logo anywhere, so I got to do that
- I am struggling with having a navbar and dropdown navigation menu coexist, I'd like to implement this if possible
- Need to adjust color for sure as it is too heavily contrasting at the moment
- Planning on adding content at the bottom of the page inside the currently empty dark background

On top of this I need to add functionality to the links and create an engaging user experience. Also open and ready to implement recommendations from my collaborators!
